# Contributing Guidelines

Read the following guide if you're interested in contributing to kube-deploy.

## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA). More information about the CLA and instructions for signing it [can be found here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the repository.

## Contributing a Patch

1. If you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details above).
1. Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.
1. Submit a pull request.

All changes must be code reviewed. Coding conventions and standards are explained in the official [developer docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/contributors/devel). Expect reviewers to request that you avoid common [go style mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments) in your PRs.

### Merge Approval

Kube-deploy maintainers may add "LGTM" (Looks Good To Me) or an equivalent comment to indicate that a PR is acceptable. Any change requires at least one LGTM.  No pull requests can be merged until at least one maintainer signs off with an LGTM.

## Support Channels

Whether you are a user or contributor, official support channels include:

- GitHub issues: https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-deploy/issues/new
- Slack: Chat with us on [Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/): #sig-cluster-lifecycle
- Email: [kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubernetes-sig-cluster-lifecycle) mailing list

Before opening a new issue or submitting a new pull request, it's helpful to search the project - it's likely that another user has already reported the issue you're facing, or it's a known issue that we're already aware of.
